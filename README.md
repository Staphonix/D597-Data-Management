# D597 – Data Management

## Overview

This repository contains coursework for WGU’s **D597 Data Management** course, which builds proficiency in both relational and non-relational database design and querying. The course covers selecting appropriate data storage architectures tailored to business needs, exploring data types and structures, normalization and denormalization, and executing complex SQL queries.

Key topics include:  
- Relational vs. non-relational databases  
- Data modeling (logical and physical)  
- SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)  
- Joins, aggregations, transactions  
- Query optimization and business-driven data analysis

---

## Course Competencies Demonstrated

- Recommending suitable data architectures based on analysis requirements  
- Examining and assessing data quality and structure for modeling  
- Designing logical data models with Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)  
- Implementing physical data models in PostgreSQL  
- Performing advanced SQL queries to answer business questions  
- Applying DDL and DML statements including joins, aggregations, and transactions

---

## Coursework Details

### Task 1: Logical and Physical Data Modeling  
- Constructed an Entity-Relationship Diagram to visually represent data entities and relationships  
- Developed normalized database schema scripts to implement the physical model (`schema.sql`)

### Task 2: Querying and Data Manipulation  
- Created and executed SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data, utilizing joins, groupings, and filters (`queries.sql`)  
- Validated queries with output screenshots (`screenshots/`) from pgAdmin

---

## Tools and Technologies

- PostgreSQL (pgAdmin interface)  
- SQL (DDL & DML)  
- Data modeling tools for ERD creation

---

## How to Use This Repository

1. View the ERD diagram (`ERD.png`) to understand the data structure and relationships.  
2. Use `schema.sql` to create the database schema and tables.  
3. Run queries in `queries.sql` to extract insights and answer business questions.  
4. Check the `screenshots/` folder for sample query results and validations.
